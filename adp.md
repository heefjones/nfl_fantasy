# ADP
Player ADPs are generally accurate, but the few outliers are what win and lose leagues. Allowing players to fall to you in the draft should increase your odds, but you still need to hit on those players. Winning your fantasy league comes down to predicting the players who outperform their ADP the most.

## 5/3

### QB
- Lots of really good QB options in 13+: Tua, Stafford, Geno, Young, Darnold.

### RB
- Achane and Bucky are undervalued, going in the mid to late 2nd.
- Many undervalued RBs in rounds 5-7: Kamara, Walker, Conner, Montgomery.
- Swift is a huge value, going as RB28 in the 7th-8th round. Rachaad is another (RB46 in round 13).
- Many value committee RBs in rounds 13-16: Rachaad, Davis, Allgier, Ekeler, Braelon, Roschon.

### WR
- Nabers is undervalued, going in late 1st round.
- Brown and Hill are values in the 2nd.
- Higgins is the highest-ranked team WR2 (WR12), but i think Davante should be higher (he's going almost a full round later).
- Of all of the undisputed WR1s, Diggs is the lowest-ranked at WR44 (round 7). Huge value on an upcoming offense.
- Respectable WR2 values: Kupp (WR49), Shaheed (WR56), Coleman (WR58), Mooney (WR50), Bech (WR61), Quentin (WR64), Legette/Thielen (WR66/69), Tolbert (WR72), Lazard (WR113), Ayomanor/Lockett (76/87).

- WR3 values:, Noel (WR62), 
Diontae Johnson, 

### TE
- 
- Mason Taylor is on an offense with an elite WR1, but the lowest-ranked WR2 (Lazard). He should secure targets in this offense. He's going as TE25 which is an insane value.
