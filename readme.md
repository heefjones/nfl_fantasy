# ADP

Player ADPs are generally accurate, but the few outliers are what win and lose leagues.
Most players generally perform around their ADP, which in the end, is a good pick. 
Allowing players to fall to you in the draft is another way to increase your odds, but you still need to hit on those players.
Essentially, winning your fantasy league comes down to predicting the players who outperform their ADP.


Every individual player's situation is unique, and must be treated as such.
