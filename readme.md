# NFL Fantasy Data (1970-2024)
This project uses NFL fantasy data from the 1970-2024 seasons (55 seasons total). The 55 CSV files were taken from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com). Each CSV contains all players who were eligible for fantasy scoring in a given season.

# ADP
Player ADPs are generally accurate, but the few outliers are what win and lose leagues. Most players generally perform around their ADP, which in the end, is a good pick. Allowing players to fall to you in the draft is another way to increase your odds, but you still need to hit on those players. Essentially, winning your fantasy league comes down to predicting the players who outperform their ADP.
